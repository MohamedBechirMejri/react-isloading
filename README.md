# react-isloading

| a nice set of loading animations for react

## How to install and Use
### install using your favorite package manager
``` npm i react-isloading ```
**or**
``` yarn add react-isloading ```
### now visit the previews page and pick the loader you like
[ty](https://google.com)
### import the desired Loader (or Loaders) into your component
```import { L5, L40 } from 'react-isloading'```
### now you can use the loader inside any component just add
```      
<L5
  style={{
    height: "15rem",
    width: "15rem",
    position: "absolute",
    top: "50%",
    left: "50%",
    transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
  }}
/>
```
you can style the loaders using the style prop, I'll probably add more features and optimizations if I need to or if requested in the issues page.
